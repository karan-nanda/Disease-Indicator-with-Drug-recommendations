# Disease-Indicator with Drug recommendations

## Medical Condition Prediction with NLP
This repository contains code for a natural language processing (NLP) trained model that detects key words and predicts medical conditions. The model is designed to predict one out of four trained conditions: Depression, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes (Type 2), and Birth Control whilst giving three drug recommendations

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of text data related to the four medical conditions: Depression, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes (Type 2), and Birth Control. The dataset has been preprocessed and labeled to facilitate the training process. Dataset for training is found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29)

## Model Architecture
The NLP model utilizes advanced techniques for keyword detection and medical condition prediction. It employs a combination of text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms to analyze input text and make predictions.

## Dependencies
The implementation of the model is done in Python using popular NLP libraries and machine learning frameworks. Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
Scikit-learn
Other necessary libraries (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
